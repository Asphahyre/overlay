		Cockatrice is an open-source multiplatform software for playing card
		games, such as Magic: The Gathering, over a network. It is fully
		client-server based to prevent any kind of cheating, though it supports
		single-player games without a network interface as well. Both client
		and server are written in Qt 4.
